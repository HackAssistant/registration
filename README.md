- `python manage.py migrate`
- `python manage.py createsuperuser` (creates super user to manage all the app)


### Dummy data

_Coming soon_

## Available enviroment variables

- **SG_KEY**: SendGrid API Key. Mandatory if you want to use SendGrid as your email backend. You can manage them [here](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys).  Note that if you don't add it the system will write all emails in the filesystem for preview.
You can replace the email backend easily. See more [here](https://djangopackages.org/grids/g/email/).
- **PROD_MODE**(optional): Disables Django debug mode. 
- **SECRET**(optional): Sets web application secret. You can generate a random secret with python running: `os.urandom(24)`
- **DATABASE_URL**(optional): URL to connect to the database. If not sets, defaults to django default SQLite database. See schema for different databases [here](https://github.com/kennethreitz/dj-database-url#url-schema).
- **DOMAIN**(optional): Domain where app will be running. Default: localhost:8000
- **SL_TOKEN**(optional): Slack token to invite hackers automatically on confirmation. You can obtain it [here](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens)
- **SL_TEAM**(optional): Slack team name (xxx on xxx.slack.com)
- **DROPBOX_OAUTH2_TOKEN**(optional): Enables DropBox as file upload server instead of local computer. (See "Set up Dropbox storage for uploaded files" below)


## Server

### Local environment

- Set up (see above)
- `python manage.py runserver`
- Sit back, relax and enjoy. That's it!

### Heroku deploy

You can deploy this project into heroku for free. You will need to verify your account to use the scheduler for automatic application expirations emails. See "Use in your hackathon" for more details on using in your hackathon.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

- Create super user by running `python manage.py createsuperuser` once the heroku app is deployed
- Add scheduler addon: https://elements.heroku.com/addons/scheduler
- Open scheduler dashboard: https://scheduler.heroku.com/dashboard (make sure it opens the just created heroku app)
- Add daily job `python manage.py expire_applications && python manage.py expire_reimbursements`

### Production environment

Inspired on this [tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu-16-04) to understand and set it up as in our server.

- Set up (see above)
- Create server.sh from template: `cp server.sh.template server.sh`
- `chmod +x server.sh`
- Edit variables to match your environment and add extra if required (see environment variables available above)
- Create restart.sh from template: `cp restart.sh.template restart.sh`
- `chmod +x restart.sh`
- Edit variables to match your environment and add extra if required (see environment variables available above)
- Run `restart.sh`. This will update the database, dependecies and static files.
- Set up Systemd (read next section)

#### Set up gunicorn service in Systemd
Needs: Systemd.

- Edit this file `/etc/systemd/system/backend.service`
- Add this content
```
[Unit]
Description=backend daemon
After=network.target

[Service]
User=user
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/home/user/project_folder
ExecStart=/home/user/project_folder/server.sh >>/home/user/project_folder/out.log 2>>/home/user/project_folder/error.log

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

- Replace `user` for your linux user.
- Replace `project_folder` by the name of the folder where the project is located
- Create and enable service: `sudo systemctl start backend && sudo systemctl enable backend`


#### Set up Postgres

Needs: PostgreSQL installed

- Enter PSQL console: `sudo -u postgres psql`
- Create database: `CREATE DATABASE backend;`
- Create user for database: `CREATE USER backenduser WITH PASSWORD 'password';` (make sure to include a strong password)
- Prepare user for Django

```sql
ALTER ROLE backenduser SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
ALTER ROLE backenduser SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';
ALTER ROLE backenduser SET timezone TO 'UTC';
```

- Grant all priviledges to your user for the created database: `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE myproject TO myprojectuser;`
- Exit PSQL console: `\q`

Other SQL engines may be used, we recommend PostgreSQL for it's robustness. To use other please check [this documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/databases/) for more information on SQL engines in Django.

##### Automatic Dropbox backup

Hackers data is really important. To ensure that you don't lose any data we encourage you to set up automatic backups. One option that is free and reliable is using the PostgresSQLDropboxBackup script. 

Find the script and usage instructions [here](https://github.com/casassg/PostgreSQL-Dropbox-Backup)

#### Set up Dropbox storage for uploaded files

This will need to be used for Heroku or some Docker deployments. File uploads sometimes don't work properly on containerized systems. 

1. Create [new DropBox app](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps)
2. Generate Access token [here](https://blogs.dropbox.com/developers/2014/05/generate-an-access-token-for-your-own-account/)
3. Set token as environment variable **DROPBOX_OAUTH2_TOKEN**

#### Set up nginx

Needs: Nginx

- `sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/default`
- Add site:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;

    server_name my.hackupc.com;


    location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
    location /static/ {
        alias /home/user/project_folder/staticfiles/;
    }
    
    location /files/ {
        alias /home/user/project_folder/files/;
    }
    
    location / {
        include proxy_params;
        proxy_pass http://unix:/home/user/project_folder/backend.sock;
        client_max_body_size 5MB;
    }


}
```

#### Deploy new version

- `git pull`
- `./restart.sh`
- `sudo service backend restart`



## Management

### Automated expiration

- Create management.sh from template: `cp management.sh.template management.sh`
- `chmod +x management.sh`
- Edit variables to match your environment and add extra if required (see environment variables available above)
- Add to crontab: `crontab -e`
```
*/5 * * * * cd /home/user/project_folder/ && ./management.sh > /home/user/project_folder/management.log 2> /home/user/project_folder/management_err.log
```

### User roles

- **is_volunteer**: Allows user to check-in hackers with QR and list view
- **is_organizer**: Allows user to vote, see voting ranking and check-in hackers.
- **is_director**: Allows user to send invites to hackers as well as send reimbursement.
- **is_admin**: Allows user to enter Django Admin interface
